#This is how to setup the coding environment at school 


1) First install Python 
2) Install Git

winget install Schniz.fnm

# configure fnm environment
fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

# download and install Node.js
fnm use --install-if-missing 22

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v22.11.0`

# Change exe policy to local user and to allow npm to run 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser

# verifies the right npm version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.9.0`
